# Retail Sales Forecasting ðŸ“ˆ

This project builds a **time-series forecasting model** to predict retail sales for a national chain.  
Goal: Improve inventory management and reduce stockouts by 15%.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- `data/` â†’ raw and processed datasets
- `notebooks/` â†’ Jupyter notebooks for exploration, modeling, and forecasting
- `scripts/` â†’ Python scripts for data cleaning, training, and utils
- `models/` â†’ trained models
- `requirements.txt` â†’ dependencies

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Place your dataset in `data/raw/retail_sales.csv`.
2. Run `notebooks/01_eda.ipynb` for exploration.
3. Run `scripts/train_model.py` to train and save a model.
4. Use `notebooks/03_forecasting.ipynb` to generate predictions.
